Description: Rideshare Coverage is specifically tailored for drivers who use their personal vehicles to provide ridesharing services like Uber or Lyft. It fills the gaps left by standard personal auto insurance policies during rideshare activity.

Coverage Includes:

Liability Coverage: Protection while you are logged into a rideshare app and providing rides.
Optional Comprehensive and Collision Coverage: You can also add comprehensive and collision coverage to protect your vehicle during rideshare operations.
Premium: Typically involves an additional fee based on expected rideshare usage, making it a flexible option for part-time drivers.
